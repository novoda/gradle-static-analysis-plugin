# Findbugs
[Findbugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) is a static analysis tool that looks for potential bugs in Java code. It does not support Kotlin.
It can be used in both pure Java, and Android Java projects. It then only makes sense to have Findbugs enabled if you have Java code in your project.
The plugin only runs Findbugs on projects that contain the Java or the Android plugin.

## Configure Findbugs
Enabling and configuring Findbugs for a project is done through the `findbugs` closure:

```gradle
findbugs {
    toolVersion // A string, most likely '3.0.1' â€” the latest Findbugs release (for a long time)
    exclude // A fileTree, such as project.fileTree('src/test/java') to exclude Java unit tests
    excludeFilter // A file containing the Findbugs exclusions, e.g., teamPropsFile('static-analysis/findbugs-excludes.xml')
    htmlReportEnabled true // Control whether html report generation should be enabled. `true` by default.
    includeVariants { variant -> ... } // A closure to determine which variants (for Android) to include
}
```

(assuming you're using the Novoda scaffolding system, see [Example configurations](#example-configurations) for more details)

You can have multiple `exclude` statements.

For more informations about Findbugs rules, refer to the [official website](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/bugDescriptions.html).

## Findbugs in mixed-language projects
If your project mixes Java and Kotlin code, your Kotlin source files will automatically be ignored.
